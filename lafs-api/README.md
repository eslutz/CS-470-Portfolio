# Angular Tutorial: Learn Angular from scratch step by step REST API

This project is a Loopback API used in part 2 of [Learn Angular from scratch step by step tutorial](https://angular-templates.io/tutorials/about/learn-angular-from-scratch-step-by-step) where we explore from the basic concepts and why‚Äôs of Angular to building a complete Angular 7 app with the MEAN stack.

The goal of this angular 7 tutorial is to guide you through the coding of a full-stack JavaScript example application project and connecting a backend API to an Angular front-end application employing the MEAN stack.

By the end of this Angular advanced tutorial, you will learn about the mean stack from scratch, including how to build a RESTful API with Loopback and using it to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB database through an Angular frontend.
